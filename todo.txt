Potential questions
* Mouse look 
* Gradually affect time
* Other options to control time (slider, mouse right/left click, q and e)




Next steps:
* Add jumping (sydney)
* Control time w/ q and e (daniel)
* Add display current time (daniel)
* Add growing element (cube to represent a plant) (marvin)
* Think of other elements to add to individual levels and implement basics in test scene (jackie / all)
